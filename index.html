<h1> Jessica Savio Yoga and Meditation </h1>
<br>
  <p>Jessica is a human just like you, on a journey filled with blessings as well as challenges.</p>
  <p>Inquisitive by nature, she began meditating as a teen, seeking to grasp the essence of her Self and the world around her. \n When later tested by loss and adversity, she was compelled to dive deeper into her inquiry, to understand the pain and trauma that so many of us experience. It was at this time that she found yoga, which proved to be invaluable to stay centered amongst the turmoil. In gratitude for the life-saving power of these practices, she committed to transmuting her lessons and experiences, offering them in service to other seekers.</p>
  <p>She trained and works with Green Tree Yoga, offering donation-based mindfulness practices to the inner city. She trained in Yoga For Healing Trauma with UpRising Yoga, also bringing yoga to under-served communities. She is trained in Reiki as well. Dedicated to life-long learning, you can expect her practice to keep evolving, both as a student and teacher.</p>
  <p>Her physical practice is alignment-focused, aimed to liberate the breath and the spine, stimulating neuroplasticity and reawakening all the neglected corners of the body. Her Yin classes are a meditative space for deep restoration, realignment and selfcare; to gently expand your limits while cultivating compassionate self-awareness. While her Hatha and Vinyasa flows can be playfully challenging at times, she offers options suited to all levels of experience, and her intention is always to hold a safe nurturing space for you to explore your own embodiment, free from any judgements or expectations.</p>
  <p>Off the mat, you can find her exploring nature, or riding her bicycle on the quest for an Earth-healing zero-waste carbon-neutral regenerative lifestyle. So catch her classes while sheâ€™s here before she vanishes into the mountains ;)</p>
